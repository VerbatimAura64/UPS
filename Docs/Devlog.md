Day 1 & 2 - Project Initialized
Created UE5 C++ third person project.
Verified build and play.

Initialized GitHub repo.

Day 3 - Improved Third person camera feel
worked on Event graphing and input mapping.
Blueprints feel overwhelming with how everything seems 
already made and needing to find needles in haystacks. Makes
me feel like I prefer just hard-coding everything and seeing
how things work. Currently working on Jump feel, and better documenting.
Brain hurts.
